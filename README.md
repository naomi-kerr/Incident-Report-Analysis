## Incident report analysis

|          ||
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Summary  | We experienced a DDoS attack that compromised the internal network. Network services stopped functioning as a flood of ICMP packets was sent from various locations (a DDoS ICMP flood attack). All internal network traffic was stopped and employees were unable to use services that required the network. Critical systems were restored by shutting down all non-critical systems.                                                                                                                                                           |
| Identify | The attack was a successful DDoS ICMP flood. The malicious actor was able to use up all of the serverâ€™s bandwidth by sending ICMP packets repeatedly, meaning internal traffic was unable to get through to the server. Users of the internal network were unable to connect to the internal network from their own devices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Protect  | After the incident, the security team created a new firewall rule to limit the rate of incoming ICMP packets. An IDS/IPS system was also implemented in order to filter out suspicious traffic like that of the attack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Detect   | Network monitoring software has been installed that monitors all traffic patterns. As well, source IP address verification was added to the firewall to detect if an IP is being spoofed on incoming ICMP packets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Respond  | The team responded by blocking the IP addresses that sent the flood of ICMP packets, taking non-critical systems offline, and focused on restoring all critical systems. In the event an attack like this occurs again, we should follow the same steps of identifying where the packets are coming from with network logs, block the traffic from accessing the server, isolate affected systems, and focus on restoring critical systems before non-critical systems. Team will report the incident to management and any required authorities. |
| Recover  | The incident management team stopped the ICMP flood, stopped all non-critical network services, and focused on restoring critical network services. In the future, external ICMP traffic should be blocked at the firewall. If internal systems are still inaccessible, stopping non-critical services will open up bandwidth for all critical systems to be restored. Once enough bandwidth is free, non-critical systems can be restored.                                                                                                       |
